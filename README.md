# BigScenes

Part of a project for CSCI8980 in the Fall of 2019 at the University of Minnesota. We were given a large set of base code missing 
quite a few parts. I implemented frustum culling, level-of-detail based on pixel-height of a model, and simpler shadow calculations
and incorporated them into the starter code.

For downloading and running please refer to the INSTRUCTIONS directory. Pretty much it is compiled with Cmake and need SDL.

The game scene I created is GEFS/Chalet/, which can be run with:
./Release/engine.exe Chalet/
