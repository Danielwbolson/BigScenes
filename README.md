# BigScenes

Part of a project for CSCI8980 in the Fall of 2019 at the University of Minnesota. We were given a large set of base code missing 
quite a few parts. I implemented frustum culling, level-of-detail based on pixel-height of a model, and simpler shadow calculations
and incorporated them into the starter code.

The game scene I created is GEFS/Chalet/
